# Image-Reconstruction-via-Bayesian-Inference
Generalized Sparse Bayesian Learning approach for Image Restoration using a Bayesian coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm on image domain and frequency domain with different additive noise. Novelly applied Gaussian Low-pass filter and Gaussian High-pass filter to the task of image reconstruction on frequency domain.
